    Valley Of Flowers National Park
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
    The Valley of Flowers, located in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve’s second core zone, is a stunning natural wonder
    in the Chamoli district of Uttaranchal.
</div>
<div class="mb-5">
    It was first discovered by British mountaineers Frank S. Smythe and R.L. Holdsworth in 1931. Frank S. Smythe later
    revisited the valley in 1937 and published a book titled “The Valley Of Flowers,” which gained international
    recognition.
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
    Spanning an area of 87.5 sq. km. at an altitude ranging from 3250 to 6750 meters, the valley remains covered in snow
    from November to May.
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
    However, in June, when the snow melts, the valley undergoes a breathtaking transformation with the blooming of
    around 300 species of wildflowers.
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
    The floral composition changes constantly, offering a vibrant display of colours throughout the three-month blooming
    period.
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
    The Valley of Flowers is also home to diverse wildlife and serves as a habitat for numerous bird species.
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
    Enclosed by majestic peaks such as Gauri Parbat, Rataban, Kuntkhal, Saptsring, and Nilgiri Parbat, the valley became a designated National Park in 1982 to protect its pristine beauty and ecological balance.
